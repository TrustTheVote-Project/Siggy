# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    title: Update Your Signature
    title_tooltip: This is only a demo system.  You can enter any personal information, and select from a list of fictional counties.  Any information is acceptable for demonstration purposes. No data will be retained for any reason.
    intro: As a voter, you can respond here to a notice or message from your local election official that there was a mismatch between your signature on file, and the signature on the return envelope for your ballot.  That’s important, because your ballot cannot be counted unless a new signature is provided that matches the signature on the envelope.
    intro_tooltip: For demonstration purposes, we’ve provided this Serif Voter web interface, but many Serif users will find the free mobile App to be more convenient for camera use, and for receiving messages from their local election official (“LEO”) about the progress of their signature update request and their ballot being counted.
    intro_more: <p>Instead of visiting your election office in person, you can respond here to provide your Signature Update Request in two parts.</p><p>1.	Provide the personal identification information that will allow your elections office to match you to a registered voter record.  Signature Update Requests are acceptable only if they match an existing record.</p><p>2.	Include your new signature by uploading a file that’s a digital photo of a recent hand signature with pen on paper — or if you are using a mobile device with a camera, tap “New Photo” as soon as you’ve written your signature on paper. </p>

      title: Serif
      body: "<p>Welcome to the demonstration system for Serif, a signature verification mobile App and service for voters who vote absentee, by mail, or from home.</p><h3>About Serif</h3><p>Serif provides a convenient way for voters to fix a critical problem that can prevent their ballot from being counted: their voter signature on file did not match the signature on the return envelope of their ballot.</p><p>Usually, a voter would have to visit their local election office in order to identify him or herself and provide a current signature to match-verify the envelope’s signature.</p><p>With the Serif mobile App (or at Serif’s web site), voters can provide the same identifying information, and use their mobile phone camera to capture an image of fresh pen-on-paper signature. The information and signature are digitally submitted to Serif’s digital repository. Serif notifies the appropriation election officials, who can access the repository to get the voter’s updated signature and, if the new signature matches, approve to the voter’s ballot to be counted.</p><h3>Tour the Serif Demo</h3><p>To see Serif in action, you can try out the 3 different faces of the Serif system. Start with “Submit a New Signature” which will take to you a web page that has the same basic functions as the Serif mobile app, but is designed for a more convenient demonstration. Click on the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></span> icon to reveal demo explanations that would not be part of a real Serif system in operation.</p><p>Next, try “LEO Dashboard” which is the web interface for local election officials (LEO) who manage the signature update process. When a voter uses Serif to submit a signature update request, Serif notifies the voter’s LEO, who then logs into the LEO Dashboard to view these requests and accept or reject them. Lastly, try “Admin Dashboard” which is the web interface for the administrators of a Serif system, who create Serif LEO accounts so that one or more LEOs in the county or locality can access the LEO Dashboard. As before, click on the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></span> icon to reveal demo explanations that would not be part of a real Serif system in operation.</p>"
